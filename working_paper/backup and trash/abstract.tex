Whether the observed number of vacancies correctly measure all job-openings in the economy can impact on analysis in the search-matching framework. In this paper we document the share of hires that happen with and without a preceding vacancy, respectively. We moreover document \emph{what the vacancy statistics miss}, by documenting how the propensity to fill job-openings via vacancies vary across firm and job characteristics. Finally, we analyse how our finding impact on labour market analysis in the search-matching framework.
